DESCRIPTION : In this project, I developed a Java-based console application that consumes a public REST API and displays the fetched data in a clean, structured format. The primary goal of the project was to understand how to integrate external data sources into Java programs and present the information meaningfully for end-users. For demonstration purposes, I chose a public weather API that provides real-time weather data for any specified location.

The project began with the selection of a reliable and free-to-use public API. I used the OpenWeatherMap API, which offers comprehensive weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and general weather conditions like rain or clear skies. I registered and obtained an API key to authenticate requests.

The application was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the IDE, taking advantage of its robust Java support and ease of use. I structured the project by keeping the logic modular, allowing clear separation between the network call, data parsing, and output formatting. The application sends an HTTP GET request to the weather API endpoint using Java's built-in HttpURLConnection class.

Once the request is made, the API returns a response in JSON format. I utilized the org.json library to parse the JSON data efficiently. The parsed data includes values such as current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity percentage, and weather description. These values were extracted and formatted using Javaâ€™s string manipulation methods to provide readable and user-friendly output on the console.

Error handling was also an important part of this project. The application is capable of detecting and reporting various issues, such as invalid city names, internet connectivity problems, or issues with the API key. Appropriate messages are displayed to inform the user of the exact issue.

Throughout the project, I learned how REST APIs work, how to send requests and handle responses, and how to manage JSON data within a Java environment. I also became familiar with the concept of API keys, endpoint URLs, and response codes, which are essential in API-based integration.

This project is highly relevant and practical, as API consumption is a vital skill in modern software development. The concept can be extended to consume other APIs for different domains such as finance, sports, news, or healthcare. The ability to fetch and display live data has many real-world applications, including building weather apps, news feeds, and live stock trackers.

In conclusion, this project helped me solidify my understanding of integrating Java applications with RESTful APIs. I now have hands-on experience in handling network requests, parsing JSON data, and presenting information meaningfully to the end-user. It served as a strong foundation for more complex projects involving API integration, data visualization, and even UI-based applications in the future.
